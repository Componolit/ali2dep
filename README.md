# Make dependency generator

`Ali2dep` generates make dependencies from an ALI file generated by GNAT. When
called on an `.ali` file, the dependencies are generated in a `.d` file with
the same base name. The `.d` files can be included in a Makefile to facilitate
rebuild when dependencies change and `gprbuild` or `gnatmake` are not used.

Note, that no path information is created for dependencies, hence a suitable
VPATH must be set in the Makefile to find the files.
